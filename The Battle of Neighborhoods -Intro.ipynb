Current to 2016, the Toronto census metropolitan area (CMA), of which the majority is within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), held a population of 5,928,040, making it Canada's most populous CMA. Toronto is the fastest growing city in North America. and is the anchor of an urban agglomeration, known as the Golden Horseshoe in Southern Ontario, located on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario.\n\nToronto contains geographical area formerly administered by many separate municipalities. These municipalities have each developed a distinct history and identity over the years, and their names remain in common use among Torontonians. Former municipalities include East York, Etobicoke, Forest Hill, Mimico, North York, Parkdale, Scarborough, Swansea, Weston and York. Throughout the city there exist hundreds of small neighborhoods and some larger neighborhoods covering a few square kilometers.\n\nWith such a vast population and big geographical area, there also exists big competition between businesses. Hence, it is very challenging for new businesses to decide which area they should start their business to get higher revenue with least competition.\n\nTarget Audience: New Businesses seeking to setup a new restaurant in Toronto\n\nThrough this project we will try to solve the above problem by suggesting Target Audience which are the best locality to open new restaurants and gain maximum profits in Toronto.\n"
